- **A/B Testing Discipline: Test creatives, copy, audiences, and bidding strategies methodically to find what works best and optimize your budget allocation.

- **Monitor & Adapt: Regularly analyze key metrics (CTR, CPC, CPA, ROAS) in your Ads Manager dashboard. Pause underperformers and scale winners.

Combining initial savings from TikTok ad credits with these ongoing optimization efforts is the key to maximizing your return on investment.
